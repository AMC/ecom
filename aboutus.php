    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <br /><br />
    <p>HAV Western Wear was founded in 1949 by three brothers: Hugo, Alfons and Victor. It started as a &quot;farm store&quot; stocking hardware, farming supplies and hiring out labor for small jobs.</p>
    <p>After a few years, Hugo and Alphons decided to return to carpentry and farming themselves, leaving Victor with the Store.</p>
    <p>Over the years, HAV evolved into a hardware and tack store, then to a tack and clothing store.</p>
    <p>Victor used to joke about having to marry a woman with an &quot;H&quot; name to keep the store's initials correct. He married &quot;Helen&quot; in 1949.</p>
    <p>Today, HAV Western wear carries quality clothing and accessories. It is owned by Victor's daughter, Vikki.</p>
